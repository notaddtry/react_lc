You can test this lc => https://notaddtry.github.io/react_lc/

In this case i worked with Redux and firebese

1)Register on register page => then u can only log in with your email and password(on login page)

2)You have been navigated to home page,where u can go to another page(contacts) or log out from system.

3)When u arrived at contacts,u can see some default state. You can edit it,add some more contacts or delete,if necessary.

4) Well done!
